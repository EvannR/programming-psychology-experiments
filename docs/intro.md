# Programming Psychology Experiments

## Objectives

- learn to build experimental psychology experiments, that is, how to create visual and auditory stimuli, to present them at precise times and possibly record participants' responses and analyse them
- learn tools to do reproducible science (github, markdown, ...)
- improve  your programming skills (clean code, real-time, ...)
```

## Pedagogy

* The lectures essentially consist of **Practical tutorials**: 
  After we introduce a topic, you have to solve challenges (with help from us if necessary). 
  
* We will use mostly Python, but also Javascript for online experiments.

* Bring your computer and have the software installed in advance !!! 


## Expectations/Evaluations

* Attendance is expected (warn me by email if you cannot attend for a good reason).

* Working during the course is also expected. At the end of lectures, I will asked to you to send me by email a copy of your work folder, with your attempts.
