# PROG-101 


**Intro to programming** 
    
   Learn basic programming concepts (variables, control structures, functions, files ) and skills (how to run a python script from a terminal, use a code editor, ...). 
   
   
   This lecture is meant for beginners. A [Self-evaluation quizz](https://forms.gle/iq7CN41DZMA6XJC59) was designed to determine which students need to attend PROG-101.

# CORE-101 

**Experimental Approaches** 

   - learn to build experimental psychology experiments:  how to create visual and auditory stimuli, to present them at precise times record participants' responses and analyse them.
   - learn tools to do reproducible science (github, markdown, ...)
   - improve  your programming skills (clean code, ...)

   Format: Practical tutorials. 
   
   *Prerequisites*: moderate knowledge of programming

# PROG-202 

**Human Experimental Workshop**

- implement a complete experiment from scratch (personal project)

*Prerequisites*: CORE-101 and/or good programming knowledge
